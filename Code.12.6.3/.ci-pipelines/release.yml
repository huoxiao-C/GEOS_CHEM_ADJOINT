# Release pipeline:
# 
# This pipeline performs deployment actions upon a GEOS-Chem release.
# Currently, the only deployment action is to build and push a docker 
# container with prebuilt GEOS-Chem executables (geos-chem-standard, 
# geos-chem-tropchem, and geos-chem-soa_svpoa) for the newly released 
# version.

# This pipeline is triggered by tagged versions excluding 
# pre-releases.
